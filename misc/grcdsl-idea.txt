---------

Risk assessment done on assets
Assets have CIA values - calculates asset values
assets have threats.

threats-vuln mapping available
vuln will have severity

Likelihood and impact values are provided

calculate risk = impact*likelihood

Exposure Factor (EF) : % of asset loss caused by threat.

Single Loss Expectancy (SLE): Frequency of threat occurrence per year.

Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) : Asset Value x Exposure Factor (EF).

Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) : Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) x Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO).
