GRC DSL using groovy
------------------------------

Abstract
---------- 

Java, and the Java platform with all its frameworks and libraries, has become a large
eco-system for the software developer. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs on every 
device from the smallest embedded chip to the largest mainframe. In this large eco-system
of Java universe, the most important thing that has happened is the evolution of Groovy
programming language. Groovy is a JVM based language which supports multiple paradigms 
such as dynamic programming, meta-programming, functional programming etc. As Groovy
inherits many of the features from Java language, it improves the developer productivity
by cutting down a lot of boilerplate code. Cutting down a lot of boiler plate code allows
to express solutions in a more concise style of coding.
	One of the benefits of Groovy is how its dynamic features support the development
of Domain-Specific languages(DSL) or "mini languages", which we can run directly on the JVM
alongside other existing Java code. A domain-specific language (DSL) is a type of programming
language or specification language in software development that is dedicated to a particular
problem domain. As MetricStream works in the domain of GRC, the idea of developing DSL's for 
GRC domain will help our customer's in customizing the business logic to suit their needs. This
is possible to do in Groovy language because of its powerful meta-programming features.
