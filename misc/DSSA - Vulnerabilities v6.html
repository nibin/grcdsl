<div id="level5Style">1.1.4.1 Considerable additional study is needed to develop a robust registry failover plan. However, based on the critical functions, transition experiences and failure scenarios described in this (interim) report, registries should consider at least the following measures:</div>
</div>
<div id="level5Indent">
<div id="level5Style">1.1.4.2 Provide for geographic diversity of name servers and have contingency plans in place. Include diversity and contingency progress and status reports in monthly reports to ICANN.</div>

</div>
<div id="level5Indent">
<div id="level5Style">1.1.4.6 As part of the new gTLD process, applicants should submit a TLD transition plan which identifies the critical functions of the registry and describes how each of those functions would be transitioned to a new operator in the event of registry failure This plan may include the identification of a back-up or temporary provider. The applicant may designate this section of the gTLD agreement or application as confidential. The transition plan is to be retained by the registry as part of the registry's overall failover plan.

</div>
<div id="level5Indent">
<div id="level5Style">1.1.7.1 Problems may arise when the registrant of a domain name A uses a DNS name server in domain B for domain name resolution, and the registrant of domain name B accidentally or intentionally allows its domain name registration to expire. In circumstances where coordination across well-intentioned parties is lost, the expected resolution of domain A may be interrupted or may become unpredictable due to A&rsquo;s dependence on the name server in domain B; in other circumstances, a new registrant of domain B may configure domain A's DNS information for malicious purposes, including phishing attacks, email interception, and redirection of Internet users to different websites with different and possibly harmful content.11 While domain A can be restored to proper function by updating the registry with a new name server (perhaps on domain A or C), this can present operational challenges to accomplish in the extreme short term.</div>

</div>
<div id="level5Indent">
<div id="level5Style">1.1.8.1 Definition</div>
</div>
<div id="levelXIndent">
<div id="levelXStyle">1.1.8.1.1 By definition, orphan records used to be glue records. A glue record becomes an "orphan" when the delegation point NS record referencing it is removed without also removing the corresponding glue record. The delegation point NS record is sometimes referred to as the parent NS record.</div>
</div>
<div id="levelXIndent">
<div id="levelXStyle">1.1.8.1.2 For instance, continuing the example from the previous section, if the EXAMPLE.TLD delegation is removed from the TLD zone but the NS.EXAMPLE.TLD glue record remains in the zone, NS.EXAMPLE.TLD has now become an orphan record because the parent NS record is no longer present in the zone but the address record remains.</div>
</div>
<div id="levelXIndent">
<div id="levelXStyle">1.1.8.1.3 The term "orphan" is chosen to signify that this record no longer has a parent NS record. Usually registrars and registrants no longer have administrative control over the orphan record in the registry when its parent NS record is removed.</div>
</div>
<div id="levelXIndent">
<div id="levelXStyle">1.1.8.1.4 Other delegated domains (not necessarily under the same TLD) might still rely on the orphan record. This situation may lead to inconsistencies and even abuse because of the lack of administrative control and lack of attribution for this orphan record.</div>
</div>
<div id="level4Indent">
<div id="level4Style">1.1.9 Inaccurate/unavailable registrar/registry "abuse" contact information</div>

<div id="level5Indent">
<div id="level5Style">1.1.9.1 Issue statement (SAC 38)</div>
</div>
<div id="levelXIndent">
<div id="levelXStyle">1.1.9.1.1 &bull; Information for several kinds of points of contact is published for registrars. Not all of these are the appropriate points of contact for dealing with abuse claims or criminal complaints. Sorting out the appropriate point of contact may delay an investigation.</div>
</div>
<div id="levelXIndent">
<div id="levelXStyle">1.1.9.1.2 &bull; Users that make inquiries or investigate abuse and illegal activities potentially involving a domain name must rely on registrars to voluntarily publish contact information that in a readily accessible manner. Anecdotal information conveyed to SSAC indicates that:</div>
</div>
<div id="levelXIndent">
<div id="levelXStyle">1.1.9.1.2.1 a) Not all registrars voluntarily publish public contact information on their web sites, b) Not all of the published contact information is accurate or complete, c) Personnel who are reached via certain published contact information may be unable to handle abuse inquiries or may be unfamiliar with escalation procedures that would put an investigator in touch with a suitable (e.g., technical) contact, and d) Not all registrars publish a separate abuse contact.</div>
</div>
<div id="levelXIndent">
<div id="levelXStyle">1.1.9.1.3 &bull; A public contact may only be available during specific business hours, whereas an abuse contact should be available 24 x 7. Inquiries involving alleged abuse or criminal activities typically require timely if not urgent response. For example, inquiries that will lead to the suspension of a domain name used in a phishing attack, in support of an illegal activity (hosting of child pornography or illegal sales of prescription pharmaceuticals) are ideally processed within hours. In the case of a &ldquo;double flux&rdquo; attack3, minutes of delay provide an attacker with sufficient time to divert his attack vector to other domain names he has registered or domains over which he has obtained unauthorized control.</div>

<div id="levelXStyle">2.6.1.8.1 SAC 40 Finding (7) Registration service providers rely more heavily on unconfirmed email to deliver security-related correspondence (e.g., change notifications) than email delivery assurance and security characteristics merit. Attackers often defeat this method of correspondence by preventing email delivery when they modify the DNS configuration of domains through compromised registration accounts.

<div id="levelXIndent">
<div id="levelXStyle">2.6.1.11.1.1 Identifying multiple points of contact offers an organization some protection in situations where a single contact is provided for all roles and that contact ceases to be employed by an organization, or in a circumstance where the only identified contact is not available to resolve a problem or respond to a reported abuse of the domain name. Distinct points of contact also offer some diversity in managing domain names. Each of these contacts can represent departments or divisions in an organization that are responsible for some aspect of domain name management. For example, while legal staff or an IP&amp;T department may be best suited to manage the registrant role, IT may be best suited to manage the technical role, corporate communications may be best suited to manage the administrative role, and finance best suited to manage the billing role.</div>

</div>
<div id="levelXIndent">
<div id="levelXStyle">2.6.1.11.2.1 Ask your registrar for a list of correspondence routinely issued by email, and consult with your registrar to determine which of your email contacts is used for routine correspondence. Use your email system to route correspondence to the organization&rsquo;s point of contact that is responsible for responding to or taking action. For example, consider whether you can route registrar email correspondence so that your technical contact receives DNS configuration change notices, your legal department receives renewal and WHOIS accuracy notices, etc.21</div>

This access also allows an attacker to modify contact and DNS configuration information for all domains managed through the user account.

<div id="levelXStyle">2.6.1.11.5.1 Email is an important component of registrant- registrar communication. Key email accounts receive registrar notifications and registration account password reset/recovery messages and thus should only be accessed by authorized parties. Maintain the security of key email accounts by strengthening client authentication. Use encryption (TLS extensions for SMTP) to protect mail client-server communications from eavesdropping. Maintain secure operations at the mail server that hosts key email accounts as well. For example, mail servers that host key email accounts should be Internet standards compliant. Consider adopting some form of email reputation, data integrity or authentication system and follow best sender, forwarding, and antispam practices published by such organizations as the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG)22 and the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG)23 so that your mail servers will not be reported to spam blacklists.</div>

<div id="levelXIndent">
<div id="levelXStyle">2.6.1.11.6.1 Large organizations often implement resource management to deal with changes in personnel or equipment to domain registrations that must be coordinated across departments or business units. These are characterized as &ldquo;add, drop, change&rdquo; processes. Domain name management shares characteristics with such resource management structures. Organizations should consider the value of using registrar correspondence to trigger intra-organizational activity. For example, an organization may want to have the technical contact for a domain name notify all departments whose system configurations include name servers upon receipt of a confirmation email from a registrar when a change to DNS name servers for the domain is made. Organizations should consider the value of implementing measures to notify registrant, technical, or administrative contacts when changes are made to any contact or configuration information for any domain name registered by the organization.</div>

Organizations should consider the value of using registrar correspondence to trigger intra-organizational activity. For example, an organization may want to have the technical contact for a domain name notify all departments whose system configurations include name servers upon receipt of a confirmation email from a registrar when a change to DNS name servers for the domain is made.

Names that were mistyped, had lapsed, had been registered but not delegated, or had never been registered in DNS were resolved as if they existed. As a consequence, certain e-mail systems, spam filters and other services failed resulting in direct and indirect costs to third parties, either in the form of increased network charges for some classes of users, a reduction in performance, or the creation of work required to compensate for the consequent failure.&rdquo;</div>
